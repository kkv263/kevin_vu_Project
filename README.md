This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
First, visit: The LOTR API at https://the-one-api.dev/.
If you haven't already sign up for an account and copy the api key listed in your account.

In the root folder create a `.env` file and add in the API Key like so, where `XXXXX` is your API Key 
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY = 'XXXXX'
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
